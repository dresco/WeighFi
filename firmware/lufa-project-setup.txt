Notes for setting up a LUFA project in eclipse
==============================================

--
Create a new AVR project in eclipse

--
Copy in LUFAConfig.h, Descriptors.c/.h files, and <project>.c/h files from any suitable LUFA demo project
		
--
Create a LUFA subdirectory, containing the following items copied from current release
  Common\
  Drivers\
  Platform\
  License.txt
  Version.h

** note: have stripped out unused LUFA architectures (just less to commit)..
 
--
Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> AVR Compiler -> Directories -> Include Paths
Configuration -> [All Configurations]
${ProjDirPath}

** note: lets the LUFA build system find the config and library files

--
Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> AVR Compiler -> Symbols
Configuration -> [All Configurations]
USE_LUFA_CONFIG_HEADER
ARCH=AVR8
F_USB=16000000
BOARD=BOARD_ADAFRUITU4

** note: F_USB gets passed to command line before F_CPU so can't just refer to that

--
Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> AVR Linker -> General -> Other Arguments
Configuration -> [All Configurations]
-Wl,--gc-sections

** note: prevents all the unused LUFA library code being linked in
